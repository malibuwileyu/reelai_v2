# Codebase Cleanup & Integration Testing Checklist ðŸ§¹

## Overview
This checklist outlines the steps needed to clean up the codebase after the rapid development sprint, ensuring stability, maintainability, and proper testing coverage.

## High-Level Goals
1. Integration Testing
   - End-to-end functionality testing
   - Critical path validation
   - Error handling verification
   - See `integration-testing.md` for details

2. Code Cleanup & Optimization
   - Remove unused code and dependencies
   - Standardize code patterns
   - Improve code organization
   - See `code-cleanup.md` for details

3. File Splitting & Modularization
   - Split large files (>250 lines)
   - Reorganize code structure
   - Update imports and exports
   - See `file-splitting.md` for details

4. UI/UX Improvements
   - Fix broken UI components
   - Standardize UI patterns
   - Improve user experience
   - See `ui-cleanup.md` for details

5. Documentation
   - Code documentation
   - API documentation
   - Setup guides
   - See `documentation-cleanup.md` for details

6. Build & Deploy Preparation
   - Environment configuration
   - Build optimization
   - Deployment automation
   - See `build-deploy-prep.md` for details
