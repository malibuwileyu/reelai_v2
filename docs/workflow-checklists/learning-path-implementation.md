## Future Administrative Server Evolution

The video processing server will evolve into a comprehensive administrative platform that will handle:

1. Learning Path Management
   - Creation and modification of learning paths
   - Curriculum structuring and sequencing
   - Content organization and tagging

2. Assessment Tools
   - Quiz creation and management
   - Test configuration and customization
   - Grading and feedback systems

3. Content Management
   - Video processing and transcription (current)
   - Resource organization and metadata
   - Version control and content updates

4. Analytics Dashboard
   - User progress tracking
   - Performance metrics
   - Usage statistics and insights

The server's infrastructure has been designed with this evolution in mind, with core components like Firebase Admin integration, security rules, and error handling already in place. Future development will focus on expanding these administrative capabilities while maintaining the existing video processing functionality.
