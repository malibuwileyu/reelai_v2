## Critical Issues ðŸš¨

### Security Vulnerabilities in Dependencies
- Current state: Multiple high and critical severity vulnerabilities reported by npm audit
- Required: Review and update dependencies to resolve security issues
- Impact: Potential security risks in production
- Priority: High (Security Issue)
- Implementation Plan:
  1. Dependency Review:
     - Run detailed npm audit
     - Document all vulnerabilities
     - Research safe upgrade paths
     - Test compatibility with updates
  2. Package Updates:
     - Update firebase-functions to >=5.1.0
     - Resolve react-test-renderer conflicts
     - Fix deprecated punycode module
     - Address glob package deprecation
  3. Testing:
     - Verify all features after updates
     - Run full test suite
     - Check for breaking changes
     - Validate build process
- Target completion: After core features (Sprint 4)
- Dependencies:
  - Package.json configurations
  - Firebase function implementations
  - Test suite stability
