  - Dependencies:
    - Video player implementation
    - Progress tracking system
    - Analytics framework

- [ ] Video Upload UI Improvements
  - Current state: No way to change video after selection, silent failures on missing title
  - Required: Improve user feedback and control during upload process
  - Impact: Better user experience and error handling
  - Priority: High (UX Critical)
  - Implementation Plan:
    1. Video Selection:
       - Add "Change Video" button after selection
       - Show selected video name/thumbnail
       - Add video preview option
       - Support drag-and-drop
    2. Error Handling:
       - Add visible error message for missing title
       - Show validation errors inline
       - Add field highlighting for required fields
       - Improve error message clarity
    3. Testing:
       - Verify video change functionality
       - Test error message display
       - Validate all error cases
       - Check accessibility
  - Target completion: Sprint 4
  - Dependencies:
    - Video upload component
    - Form validation system
    - UI component library

- [ ] Featured Content Vertical Scroller
  - Current state: Using standard miniplayer cards for all video displays
  - Required: Limited vertical scroller for featured/recommended content only
  - Impact: Enhanced engagement for discovery while maintaining learning focus
  - Priority: Low (UX Enhancement)
  - Implementation Plan:
    1. Technical Requirements:
       - Implement vertical swipe gesture system
       - Add video preloading for smooth transitions
