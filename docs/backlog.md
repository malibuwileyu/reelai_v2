# ReelAI Development Backlog

This file tracks features, improvements, and tasks that are not currently prioritized but may be implemented in the future.

## Critical Issues ðŸš¨

### Security Vulnerabilities in Dependencies
- Current state: Multiple high and critical severity vulnerabilities reported by npm audit
- Required: Review and update dependencies to resolve security issues
- Impact: Potential security risks in production
- Priority: High (Security Issue)
- Implementation Plan:
  1. Dependency Review:
     - Run detailed npm audit
     - Document all vulnerabilities
     - Research safe upgrade paths
     - Test compatibility with updates
  2. Package Updates:
     - Update firebase-functions to >=5.1.0
     - Resolve react-test-renderer conflicts
     - Fix deprecated punycode module
     - Address glob package deprecation
  3. Testing:
     - Verify all features after updates
     - Run full test suite
     - Check for breaking changes
     - Validate build process
- Target completion: After core features (Sprint 4)
- Dependencies:
  - Package.json configurations
  - Firebase function implementations
  - Test suite stability

### Video Processing Framework Issues
- Current state: Video duration detection fails in processing context
- Required: Fix expo-av Video component initialization and metadata extraction
- Impact: Non-critical (metadata still available through other means)
- Priority: Medium (Technical Debt)
- Implementation Plan:
  1. Framework Updates:
     - Research alternatives to expo-av for processing context
     - Implement proper Video component initialization
     - Add fallback duration detection methods
  2. Error Handling:
     - Improve metadata extraction resilience
     - Add proper error recovery
     - Enhance logging for debugging
  3. Testing:
     - Add comprehensive tests for video processing
     - Verify metadata extraction in all contexts
     - Validate error handling
- Target completion: After core features (Sprint 4)
- Dependencies:
  - expo-av framework
  - Video processing pipeline
  - Metadata handling system

## Feature Ideas
- [ ] Progress Bar Dragging Implementation
  - Current state: Progress bar is view-only, no seeking via drag
  - Required: Add drag functionality while ensuring fair progression tracking
  - Impact: Improves user experience while maintaining learning integrity
  - Priority: Medium (UX Enhancement)
  - Implementation Plan:
    1. Technical Requirements:
       - Add drag gesture handling to progress bar
       - Implement smooth seeking during drag
       - Add visual feedback during drag operation
       - Ensure proper state updates during/after drag
    2. Fair Progression:
       - Track actual time watched vs. skipped sections
       - Prevent credit for unwatched sections
       - Consider implementing minimum watch time requirements
       - Add analytics for seeking behavior
    3. Testing:
       - Verify smooth drag operation
       - Validate progression tracking accuracy
       - Test edge cases (rapid seeking, network issues)
       - Verify progress persistence
  - Target completion: After core features (Sprint 5)
  - Dependencies:
    - Video player implementation
    - Progress tracking system
    - Analytics framework
