- Firebase Auth persistence needs to be implemented using AsyncStorage to persist auth state between app restarts
  - Current state: Auth state is lost on app restart
  - Required: Research and implement proper persistence solution for React Native
  - Impact: Users need to log in again after app restart
  - Priority: Medium
  - Notes: Initial attempt with getReactNativePersistence caused compatibility issues

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Firebase Storage Rules need to be properly secured
  - Current state: Rules are set to allow all read/write operations (`if true`) for development
  - Required: Implement proper security rules following the pattern:
    ```javascript
    service firebase.storage {
      match /b/{bucket}/o {
        match /profile-pictures/{userId}/{fileName} {
          allow read: if request.auth != null;
          allow write: if request.auth != null 
                       && request.auth.uid == userId
                       && request.resource.size < 5 * 1024 * 1024
                       && request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*');
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  - Priority: High (must be done before production)
  - Risk: Current setup allows unrestricted access to storage
  - Target completion: Before any production deployment
  - Current temporary rules (for development only):
    ```javascript
    rules_version = '2';
    service firebase.storage {
      match /b/{bucket}/o {
        match /{allPaths=**} {
          allow read, write: if true;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## Nice-to-Have Improvements
